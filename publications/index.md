<p><span class="citation">1. <strong>Julia: A fresh approach to numerical computing</strong>. Jeff Bezanson, Alan Edelman, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah (2014), <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1607" class="uri">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1607</a><p><blockquote><em>Abstract:</em> The Julia programming language is gaining enormous popularity. Julia was designed to be easy and fast. Most importantly, Julia shatters deeply established notions widely held in the applied community:1. High-level, dynamic code has to be slow by some sort of law of nature. 2. It is sensible to prototype in one language and then recode in another language. 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts.Julia began with a deep understanding of the needs of the scientific programmer and the needs of the computer in mind. Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from computer science and computational science creating a new approach to scientific computing. This note introduces the programmer to the language and the underlying design theory. It invites the reader to rethink the fundamental foundations of numerical computing systems.In particular, there is the fascinating dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. We can pick just the right algorithm for the right circumstance and this can happen at runtime based on argument types (code selection via multiple dispatch). Abstraction recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away and ignored as irrelevant. The recognition of abstraction allows for code reuse (generic programming). A simple idea that yields incredible power. The Julia design facilitates this interplay in many explicit and subtle ways for machine performance and, most importantly, human convenience.</blockquote></p></span></p>

Jeff Bezanson, Jiahao Chen, Stefan Karpinski, Viral Shah, Alan Edelman (2014), <em>ARRAY’14 Proceedings of ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Libraries, Languages, and Compilers for Array Programming</em>, 56–61, doi:<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2627373.2627383">10.1145/2627373.2627383</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3845" class="uri">http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3845</a><p><blockquote><em>Abstract:</em> Arrays are such a rich and fundamental data type that they tend to be built into a language, either in the compiler or in a large low-level library. Defining this functionality at the user level instead provides greater flexibility for application domains not envisioned by the language designer. Only a few languages, such as C++ and Haskell, provide the necessary power to define n-dimensional arrays, but these systems rely on compile-time abstraction, sacrificing some flexibility. In contrast, dynamic languages make it straightforward for the user to define any behavior they might want, but at the possible expense of performance. As part of the Julia language project, we have developed an approach that yields a novel trade-off between flexibility and compile-time analysis. The core abstraction we use is multiple dispatch. We have come to believe that while multiple dispatch has not been especially popular in most kinds of programming, technical computing is its killer application. By expressing key functions such as array indexing using multi-method signatures, a surprising range of behaviors can be obtained, in a way that is both relatively easy to write and amenable to compiler analysis. The compact factoring of concerns provided by these methods makes it easier for user-defined types to behave consistently with types in the standard library.</blockquote></p></span></p>

Shah, Alan Edelman (2012), <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5145" class="uri">http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5145</a><p><blockquote><em>Abstract:</em> Dynamic languages have become popular for scientific computing. They are generally considered highly productive, but lacking in performance. This paper presents Julia, a new dynamic language for technical computing, designed for performance from the beginning by adapting and extending modern programming language techniques. A design based on generic functions and a rich type system simultaneously enables an expressive programming model and successful type inference, leading to good performance for a wide range of programs. This makes it possible for much of the Julia library to be written in Julia itself, while also incorporating best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries.</blockquote></p></span></p>

<p><span class="citation">4. <strong>CauseMap: Fast inference of causality from complex time series</strong>. M. Cyrus Maher, Ryan D. Hernandez (2015), doi:<a href="https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.583v2">10.7287/peerj.preprints.583v2</a><p><blockquote><em>Abstract:</em> Background: Establishing health-related causal relationships is a central pursuit in biomedical research. Yet, the interdependent non-linearity of biological systems renders causal dynamics laborious and at times impractical to disentangle. This pursuit is further impeded by the dearth of time series that are sufficiently long to observe and understand recurrent patterns of flux. However, as data generation costs plummet and technologies like wearable devices democratize data collection, we anticipate a coming surge in the availability of biomedically-relevant time series data. Given the life-saving potential of these burgeoning resources, it is critical to invest in the development of open source software tools that are capable of drawing meaningful insight from vast amounts of time series data.Results: Here we present CauseMap, the first open source implementation of convergent cross mapping (CCM), a method for establishing causality from long time series data (&gt;  25 observations). Compared to existing time series methods, CCM has the advantage of being model-free and robust to unmeasured confounding that could otherwise induce spurious associations. CCM builds on Takens’ Theorem, a well-established result from dynamical systems theory that requires only mild assumptions. This theorem allows us to reconstruct high dimensional system dynamics using a time series of only a single variable. These reconstructions can be thought of as shadows of the true causal system. If the reconstructed shadows can predict points from the opposing time series, we can infer that the corresponding variables are providing views of the same causal system, and so are causally related. Unlike traditional metrics, this test can establish the directionality of causation, even in the presence of feedback loops. Furthermore, since CCM can extract causal relationships from times series of, e.g. a single individual, it may be a valuable tool to personalized medicine. We implement CCM in Julia, a high-performance programming language designed for facile technical computing. Our software package, CauseMap, is platform-independent and freely available as an official Julia package.Conclusions: CauseMap is an efficient implementation of a state-of-the-art algorithm for detecting causality from time series data. We believe this tool will be a valuable resource for biomedical research and personalized medicine.</blockquote></p></span></p>

Convex translates problems from a user-friendly functional language into an abstract syntax tree describing the problem. This concise representation of the global structure of the problem allows Convex to infer whether the problem complies with the rules of disciplined convex programming (DCP), and to pass the problem to a suitable solver. These operations are carried out in Julia using multiple dispatch, which dramatically reduces the time required to verify DCP compliance and to parse a problem into conic form. Convex then automatically chooses an appropriate backend solver to solve the conic form problem.</blockquote></p></span></p>

In particular, we demonstrate algebraic modeling for linear and nonlinear optimization and a partial implementation of a practical simplex code. Extensive cross-language benchmarks suggest that Julia is capable of obtaining state-of-the-art performance.</blockquote></p></span></p>

The algorithm computes each eigenvalue and all components of the corresponding eigenvector with high relative accuracy in O(n) operations. The algorithm is based on a shift-and-invert approach. Only a single element of the inverse of the shifted matrix eventually needs to be computed with double the working precision. Each eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector can be computed separately, which makes the algorithm adaptable for parallel computing. Our results extend to the complex Hermitian case.

By using accurate forward stable algorithm for computing eigenvalues of real symmetric arrowhead matrices from (Jakovcevic Stor, Slapnicar, Barlow, 2015), we derive a forward stable algorithm for computation of roots of such polynomials in O(n2) operations. The algorithm computes each root to almost full accuracy. In some cases, the algorithm invokes extended precision routines, but only in the non-iterative part.

The algorithm is based on Newton’s method with carefully selected initial guesses for the nodes and a fast evaluation scheme for the associated orthogonal polynomial. In the Gauss-Hermite case the initial guesses and evaluation scheme rely on explicit asymptotic formulas. For generalized Gauss-Hermite, the initial guesses are furnished by sampling a certain equilibrium measure and the associated polynomial evaluated via a Riemann-Hilbert reformulation. In both cases the n-point quadrature rule is computed in O(n) operations to an accuracy that is close to machine precision. For sufficiently large n, some of the quadrature weights have a value less than the smallest positive normalized floating-point number in double precision and we exploit this fact to achieve a complexity as low as O(sqrt(n))).</blockquote></p></span></p>

Although Julia is dynamically typed it is very fast and usually yields C speed by utilizing a just-in-time compiler. Still, Julia has a simple syntax that is similar to Matlab, which is widely known as an easy-to-use programming environment. While Julia is very versatile and provides asynchronous programming facilities in the form of tasks (coroutines) as well as distributed multi-process parallelism, one missing feature is shared memory multi-threading.

Multiscale problems are problems where the coefficients of a PDE oscillate rapidly on a microscopic length scale, but solutions are sought on a much larger, macroscopic domain. Solving multiscale problems requires both a theoretic result, i.e., a homogenization result yielding effective coefficients, as well as numerical solutions of the PDE at the microscopic and the macroscopic length scales.Numerical homogenization of PDEs with stochastic coefficients is especially computationally expensive. Under certain assumptions, effective coefficients can be found, but their calculation involves subtle numerical problems. The computational cost is huge due to the generally large number of stochastic dimensions.Multiscale problems arise in many applications, e.g., in uncertainty quantification, in the rational design of nanoscale sensors, and in the rational design of materials.Our code for the numerical stochastic homogenization of elliptic problems is implemented in Julia. Since multiscale problems pose new numerical problems, it is in any case necessary to develop new numerical codes. Julia is a dynamic language inspired by the Lisp family of languages, it is open-source, and it provides native-code compilation, access to highly optimized linear-algebra routines, support for parallel computing, and a powerful macro system. We describe our experience in using Julia and discuss the advantages of Julia’s features in this problem domain.</blockquote></p></span></p>

Data-augmentation has been proposed for obtaining draws from the posterior distribution of the parameters. Within this approach, the discrete time observations are augmented with diffusion bridges connecting these observations. This poses two challenges: (i) efficiently generating diffusion bridges; (ii) if unknown parameters appear in the diffusion coefficient, then direct implementation of data-augmentation results in an induced Markov chain which is reducible. In this paper we show how both challenges can be addressed in continuous time (before discretisation) by using guided proposals. These are Markov processes with dynamics described by the stochastic differential equation of the diffusion process with an additional term added to the drift coefficient to guide the process to hit the right end point of the bridge. The form of these proposals naturally provides a mapping that decouples the dependence between the diffusion coefficient and diffusion bridge using the driving Brownian motion of the proposals. As the guiding term has a singularity at the right end point, care is needed when discretisation is applied for implementation purposes. We show that this problem can be dealt with by appropriately time changing and scaling of the guided proposal process. In two examples we illustrate the performance of the algorithms we propose. The second of these concerns a diffusion approximation of a chemical reaction network with a four-dimensional diffusion driven by an eight-dimensional Brownian motion.</blockquote></p></span> Code available in <a href="https://github.com/mschauer/ChemicalLangevin.jl">ChemicalLangevin.jl</a>.</p>

We propose a stochastic algorithm for collapsed variational Bayesian inference for LDA, which is simpler and more efficient than the state of the art method. In experiments on large-scale text corpora, the algorithm was found to converge faster and often to a better solution than previous methods. Human-subject experiments also demonstrated that the method can learn coherent topics in seconds on small corpora, facilitating the use of topic models in interactive document analysis software.</blockquote></p></span></p>

To tackle this problem, we propose a Bayesian learning algorithm for DP mixture models. Instead of following the conventional paradigm – random initialization plus iterative update, we take an progressive approach. Starting with a given prior, our method recursively transforms it into an approximate posterior through sequential variational approximation. In this process, new components will be incorporated on the fly when needed. The algorithm can reliably estimate a DP mixture model in one pass, making it particularly suited for applications with massive data. Experiments on both synthetic data and real datasets demonstrate remarkable improvement on efficiency – orders of magnitude speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art.</blockquote></p></span></p>

One way to employ linear algebra techniques for graph algorithms is to use a broader definition of matrix and vector multiplication. We demonstrate through the use of the Julia language system how easy it is to explore semirings using linear algebraic methodologies.</blockquote></p></span></p>

Our method aims at extracting such constraints from rapidly accumulating sequence data, and thereby at inferring protein structure and function from sequence information alone. Recently, global statistical inference methods (e.g. direct-coupling analysis, sparse inverse covariance estimation) have achieved a breakthrough towards this aim, and their predictions have been successfully implemented into tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction methods. However, due to the discrete nature of the underlying variable (amino-acids), exact inference requires exponential time in the protein length, and efficient approximations are needed for practical applicability. Here we propose a very efficient multivariate Gaussian modeling approach as a variant of direct-coupling analysis: the discrete amino-acid variables are replaced by continuous Gaussian random variables. The resulting statistical inference problem is efficiently and exactly solvable. We show that the quality of inference is comparable or superior to the one achieved by mean-field approximations to inference with discrete variables, as done by direct-coupling analysis. This is true for (i) the prediction of residue-residue contacts in proteins, and (ii) the identification of protein-protein interaction partner in bacterial signal transduction. An implementation of our multivariate Gaussian approach is available at the website &lt;a href=“http://areeweb.polito.it/ricerca/cmp/node/521”&gt;http://areeweb.polito.it/ricerca/cmp/code&lt;/a&gt;.</blockquote></p></span> Code available in <a href="https://github.com/carlobaldassi/GaussDCA.jl">GaussDCA.jl</a>.</p>

An important requirement here is to keep the programmer’s productivity at the same high level as if he would use Julia without a GPU. Indeed, very specialized and detailed technical knowledge is needed in order to program a GPU, making it complex and time-consuming. In many modern scientific domains quite a lot of brute computing power is required, but often these domains lack the technical expertise to use GPUs in an efficient manner.The purpose of this thesis is to provide access to a GPU from Julia in a way that shields the GPU details from the programmer. In a first step we define and implement in Julia abstractions that can be executed in parallel on the GPU. Next we adapt the Julia compiler such that it can translate these abstractions to GPU code. The resulting compiler infrastructure manages the GPU in a way that is transparent to the programmer. Finally we evaluate the abstractions and compiler infrastructure in the context of a concrete application, namely the trace transform.</blockquote></p></span></p>
