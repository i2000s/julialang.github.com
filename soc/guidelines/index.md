# Application Guidelines

Proposals are free-form and you can talk about your project however you want; the key things we want to know are what your project is all about, why it's interesting, and why you're the one for the job! We're happy to answer questions at juliasoc@googlegroups.com, so go ahead and ask if anything isn't clear.

Once you have a draft you can submit it via the GSoC application website as a Google doc and we may be able to provide feedback. You can also email our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/julia-users) for feedback in public from the wider community (but this is completely optional).

Some points that you may want to address:

* **The proposal.** What do you want to do?
  - What do you want to have completed by the end of the program?
    - For example, "a package for doing X which any Julia user can install" or "an extra feature for Foo.jl that does Y"
  - Who's interested in the work, and how will it benefit them?
    - For example, "bioinformaticians will be able to set up sequencing pipelines flexibly in pure Julia"
    - It's important to justify the project for people who may not be experts in your subject area.
  - What are the potential hurdles you might encounter, and how can you resolve them?
    - Is there anything you need to learn about as part of the work? Does your work depend on anyone else's to make progress?
  - How will you prioritise different aspects of the project like features, API usability, documentation, and robustness?
  - Does your project have any milestones that you can target throughout the period?
    - For example, getting a working prototype out to beta testers by the halfway point
  - Are there any stretch goals you can make if the main project goes smoothly? Tell us how you're going to wow us with the final result!

* **Code portfolio.** Show us a sample of code that you're proud of. Bonus points if you've written Julia code before, but we mostly care about seeing what you can do, and the skills that you want to bring to the Julia community. You don't need to be a star programmer as long as you can demonstrate interest in and commitment to your project.

* **About you.** Why you? Give us a sense of who you are as a person and as a programmer.
  - What academic, professional or hobby programming experience do you have, and how will it help you with your project?
  - Have you contributed to open source projects before? (Link us to some issues and patches, if any)
  - Why are you interested in Julia? Have you used it much before?
  - How should we contact you? Let us know your email address and GitHub username.
  - Do you have a website or blog?
  - Anything else you'd like to mention!

* **Logistics.**
  - What other time commitments, such as summer courses, other jobs, planned vacations, etc., will you have over the summer?
